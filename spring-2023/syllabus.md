# W&M DATA 340-02 - Network Science, Spring 2023 Syllabus

[Jump to Summary Schedule](#summary-schedule) | [Self](https://github.com/anwala/teaching-network-science/blob/main/spring-2022/syllabus.md)

## Course Overview

Network Science -- Networks are everywhere in our lives: networks of friends on social media, the Web, networks of neurons in our brains, etc. It's amazing that such a simple representation --- dots and lines --- can capture a variety of relationships, whether simple or complex.

**Catalog Description:** In this course, we will survey a broad range of fundamental topics in network science, relevant to students from data/computer science and engineering, informatics, business, biology, physics, statistics, social sciences, etc. For example, we will explore the properties of social networks and the key role of hubs, and how directed and weighted networks affect the spread of information and misinformation in social media. These topics are important and useful in many job sectors from marketing to technology, management to design, and from biology to the arts and humanities. 

**Prerequisites:** CSCI 140 OR DATA 140 OR CSCI 141 OR DATA 141 OR C141 1.

## Requirements

### Prerequisites

Prerequisites: Student should have taken CSCI 140 OR DATA 140 OR CSCI 141 OR DATA 141 OR C141 1 OR approval from the instructor.

We will be using Python this semester. You are not required to know Python ahead of time, but since *you are required to have previous programming experience*, I expect you to be able to pick up the syntax quickly. If you are unfamiliar with Python, I strongly suggest that you spend a bit of time with it before the semester begins.

Here are some good Intro to Python resources:

* [Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)
* [Introduction to Python](http://introtopython.org/)
* [CS 1110: Introduction to Computing Using Python](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2012fa/) (Cornell University)
* [A Gentle Introduction to Programming Using Python](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/lectures/) (MIT)
* [Python Track: Introduction](http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/python/index.html) (Cal Tech)
* [Python in One Easy Lesson](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~nick/python-in-one-easy-lesson/), Nick Parlante

### Textbook

The recommended textbook for this class is: 

> Menczer, F., Fortunato, S., & Davis, C. (2020). [A First Course in Network Science](https://www.amazon.com/First-Course-Network-Science/dp/1108471137). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/9781108653947

Reach out to me if you're unable to get a personal copy. See also,

## Grading

There will be a total of **105 points** (60 points for assignments, 20 points evenly split between midterm and final exams, and 20 points for participation/attendance/assigned readings), and **5 extra** credits points. I'd advise you to do as many extra credits as possible. Consider them as a safety net.

### Assignment Types

I will post all assignments on our DATA 340-02 Piazza forum. Your grade in this class will be based on the following components:

**Homework (HW)** - **60** points + **5** extra-credit points

* XX homework assignments (HWXX -- HWXX), each worth XX points
* *Don't wait until the last minute --- some are hard and time-consuming!*
* All work must be your own. You may use resources (e.g., Stack Overflow) on the Internet for reference. If you use online resources, you must cite your sources (including URL). Group work on HW assignments is not acceptable.

**Participation/Attendance** - **20** points

Participation is very important, it improves learning and contributes additional dimensions to discussions. I'd encourage participation by assigning scores to the following activities throughout the semester:
* 1 point maximum per week: Engaging in productive discussions in class: asking/answering questions and contributing new ideas, and posting a solution and/or replying to a question on Piazza
* 1 point maximum per week: Unannounced in-class quizzes

**Midterm exam** - **10** points

**Final exam**   - **10** points

### Grading Scale

| Numerical Grade | Letter Grade | | Numerical Grade | Letter Grade |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 93 -- 100 | A | | 73 -- 76 | C |
| 90 -- 92 | A- | | 70 -- 72 | C- |
| 87 -- 89 | B+ | | 67 -- 69 | D+ |
| 83 -- 86 | B| | 63 -- 66 | D |
| 80 -- 82 | B- | | 60 -- 62 | D- |
| 77 -- 79 | C+ | | 00 -- 59 | F |

### Grading appeals
You have two mutually exclusive options to appeal a grade:
* Schedule a meeting or meet me during office hours to discuss ways you can improve on future assignments
* Write a detailed explanation on why your work merits a higher grade. If you choose this option, I'll read your explanation and re-grade your assignment. Your grade may go up, down, or stay the same. We will meet again to discuss your work.

The course Piazza forum should be your first reference for questions about the class. If you have questions about the course requirements or materials, post your questions on Piazza. For extra help, attend [office hours](https://alexandernwala.com/contact/).

### [Student Accessibility Services](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentaccessibilityservices/)

W&M's Student Accessibility Services offer a variety of services (e.g., [Watson Lab](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentaccessibilityservices/students/services/watsonlab/index.php) and [special needs housing](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentaccessibilityservices/students/services/specialhousing/index.php)) for William & Mary students.

The mission of Student Accessibility Services is to create a barrier-free environment for matriculating students with debilitating diagnosed conditions by considering reasonable accommodations upon request on an individual and flexible basis. 

Student Accessibility Services strives to foster student independence, to encourage self-determination, to emphasize empowerment and accommodation over limitation, and to create a comprehensive, accessible environment to ensure that individuals are viewed on the basis of contribution, not deficit.

## W&M's [Honor Code](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/communityvalues/studenthandbook/honor_system/index.php)

Among the most significant traditions of William & Mary is its student-administered honor system. The essence of the honor system is individual responsibility. We entrust students to maintain the Code and adjudicate matters involving alleged violations of the Code.

The Honor Code is an enduring tradition at the University with documented history that originates as far back as 1736. Today, students administer the Honor pledge to each incoming student and educate faculty and administration on the relevance of the Code and its application to students' lives at the University. Students administer the Code through six Honor Councils and the Council of Chairs.

The Honor Code prohibits lying, cheating, and stealing. For definitions of each offense, view [Section VI: Infractions](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/communityvalues/studenthandbook/honor_system/section_VI/index.php) of the Honor Code.
* **Lying:** the presentation of false information with the intent to deceive.
* **Cheating:** including, but not limited to, the following acts: 
  * Plagiarism
  * Unauthorized Assistance/Collaboration
  * Use of Unauthorized Materials
  * Unauthorized Dual Submission of Previous Academic Work
  * Time Constraint Violation
  * Directions Violation
* **Stealing:** knowingly taking or appropriating the property of another, including property of the university, without the rightful owner‚Äôs permission and with the intent to deprive the owner of the property permanently or substantially. One does not receive rightful permission if it is induced by fraud or deception.
